# HyperMultitudes

Multitudes that scale over time.

I'm making this because credits are important and stuff, so uh...

This mod is based on the original Multitudes source (and was originally based on the ZetArtifacts mod, but I removed the "artifact" aspect, so uh no longer but still).

The math expression parser part of the mod is based on [this amazing Medium article](https://medium.com/@toptensoftware/writing-a-simple-math-expression-engine-in-c-d414de18d4ce).

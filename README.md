# HyperMultitudes

Multitudes that scale over time, as an artifact.

I'm making this because credits are important and stuff, so uh...

This mod is based on the original Multitudes source (and the ZetArtifacts mod, especially the Artifact of Multitudes).
The math expression parser part of the mod is based on [this amazing Medium article](https://medium.com/@toptensoftware/writing-a-simple-math-expression-engine-in-c-d414de18d4ce).
